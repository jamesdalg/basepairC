\title{Normalize a count matrix by removing zero rows/columns and applying SCN normalization}
\usage{
scn_normalize_to_original_scale(count_mat, original_scale = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{count_mat}{A matrix containing the counts to be normalized.}

\item{original_count_mat}{A matrix containing the original counts, used to revert the scaling after SCN normalization.}
}
\value{
A normalized count matrix with the same dimensions and row/column names as the original matrix.
}
\description{
This function processes a given count matrix by removing zero rows and columns,
applying SCN normalization, and then restoring the matrix to its original dimensions
and scale. Zero rows and columns are added back after normalization to maintain
the original structure of the count matrix.
}
\examples{
count_mat <- matrix(sample(0:10, 100, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10)
original_count_mat <- count_mat
result <- normalize_count_matrix(count_mat, original_count_mat)
}
