\title{Convert Cell IDs to Genomic Interactions}
\usage{
cell_ids_to_gint(cell_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_ids}{A character vector of cell IDs, where each element is 
expected to contain chromosome and coordinate information separated by 
underscores or spaces. The expected format for each ID is: 
\code{chr1_start1_end1_chr2_start2_end2}.}
}
\value{
A \code{GenomicInteractions} object representing the genomic 
interactions defined by the input cell IDs.
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of cell IDs and converts them into a 
\code{GenomicInteractions} object. The cell IDs are expected to be 
formatted as strings with chromosome and genomic coordinates separated 
by underscores or spaces. The function splits the cell IDs into 
components, creates two \code{GRanges} objects (one for each genomic 
anchor), and combines them into a \code{GenomicInteractions} object.
}
\examples{
cell_ids <- c("chr1_100_200_chr2_300_400", "chr1_500_600_chr2_700_800")
interactions <- cell_ids_to_gint(cell_ids)
