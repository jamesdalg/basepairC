\title{Mix and Combine Segments from Two Objects}
\usage{
mix_segments(seg_ob1, seg_ob2)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg_ob1}{A list of vectors, where each vector contains segments to be combined.}

\item{seg_ob2}{Another list of vectors, of the same length as `seg_ob1`, to be combined with `seg_ob1`.}
}
\value{
A list of vectors, where each vector contains the unique and sorted combination of the corresponding elements from `seg_ob1` and `seg_ob2`.
}
\description{
This function takes two segment objects (lists of vectors), combines the segments element-wise, removes duplicates, and sorts the resulting segments.
}
\details{
The function first determines the minimum length between `seg_ob1` and `seg_ob2` to ensure that elements are combined safely. 
For each element pair (from `seg_ob1` and `seg_ob2`), it combines the segments, removes duplicates, and sorts the result in ascending order. 
The final result is returned as a list of these combined segments.
}
\examples{
seg1 <- list(c(1, 2, 3), c(5, 6))
seg2 <- list(c(2, 4), c(6, 7))
mixed_segments <- mix_segments(seg1, seg2)
# Returns list: list(c(1, 2, 3, 4), c(5, 6, 7))
