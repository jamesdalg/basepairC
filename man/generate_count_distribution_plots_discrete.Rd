\title{Generate Discrete Distribution Plots for Control and Treatment Groups}
\usage{
generate_count_distribution_plots_discrete(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing at least the columns `treatment` and `value`.
The `treatment` column should have at least two levels: "ctrl" for control
and "trt" for treatment.}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing the distribution plot objects for both the control
        (control_plot) and treatment (treatment_plot) groups. Each object is the result
        of the `descdist` function, providing a comprehensive analysis of the empirical
        distribution for each group.
}
\description{
This function applies the `descdist` function from the `fitdistrplus` package to generate
discrete distribution plots for two subsets of data: control and treatment groups.
Each group's data is filtered from the main dataframe, and the distribution of the
`value` column is analyzed.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `data` is a dataframe with `treatment` and `value` columns
plots <- generate_count_distribution_plots_discrete(data)
# You can then access each plot object via plots$control_plot and plots$treatment_plot

}
